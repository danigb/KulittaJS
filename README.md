# KulittaJS

A port of some parts of [Kulitta's](https://github.com/donya/Kulitta) (the grammar generator and chord spaces) to Javascript + [Flow](https://flowtype.org)

The ambitious envision of this project would be to create an online version of
Kulitta with audio generation (via Web Audio API), but it's at the very beginning.

The source code, that follows the Haskell tradition in literate programming, is
heavily annotated. You can [read it here](https://danigb.github.io/KulittaJS/).
The idea is to be as close as possible to the Haskell version, following the
idiosyncrasies of Javascript, and explore the expresiveness posibilities of flow
(this is the first time I use it).

**Work in progress**.
